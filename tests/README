Acceptance test are found here

The tests are using frisbyjs: http://frisbyjs.com and require nodejs installed.

Install test dependencies with: npm install jasmine-node frisby validator

The idea is to have a seperate folder for every endpoint, and have seperate tests in seperate files.

I have written the tests so that any dependancies are created first, follwed by the test.
